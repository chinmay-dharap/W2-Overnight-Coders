W2 - Server based Monitoring & Analysis Tools

We are using Elastic Stack for Indexing and aggreegation of logs and network traffic 
We are also using metric beat to monitor metrics of operating systems 

And for the visualisations we are using the Kibana Dashboard with Elastic Server running on Ubuntu 

Because we are using all the open source softwares and integrating them with each other we dont have a physical code to upload
